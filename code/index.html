            <h2>Key Facts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Affordable, effective and feasible strategies exist to promote, protect and restore mental health.
                </li>
                <li>The need for action on mental health is indisputable and urgent.</li>
                <li>Mental health has intrinsic and instrumental value and is integral to our well-being.</li>
                <li>Mental health is determined by a complex interplay of individual, social and structural stresses and
                    vulnerabilities.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Concepts in Mental Health</h2>
            <p>Mental health is a state of mental well-being that enables people to cope with the stresses of life,
                realize their abilities, learn well and work well, and contribute to their community. It is an integral
                component of health and well-being that underpins our individual and collective abilities to make
                decisions, build relationships and shape the world we live in. Mental health is a basic human right. And
                it is crucial to personal, community and socio-economic development.</p>

            <div class="quote">“Mental health is more than the absence of mental disorders. It exists on a complex
                continuum, which is experienced differently from one person to the next.”</div>
            <div class="images">
                <img src="second.jpg" alt="Mental health illustration">
                <img src="third.jpg" alt="">
            </div>


            <h2>Determinants of Mental Health</h2>
            <p>Throughout our lives, multiple individual, social and structural determinants may combine to protect or
                undermine our mental health and shift our position on the mental health continuum.</p>
            <p>Individual psychological and biological factors such as emotional skills, substance use and genetics can
                make people more vulnerable to mental health problems.</p>
            <p>Exposure to unfavorable social, economic, geopolitical and environmental circumstances – including
                poverty, violence, inequality and environmental deprivation – also increases people’s risk of
                experiencing mental health conditions.</p>

            <h2>Mental Health Promotion and Prevention</h2>
            <p>Promotion and prevention interventions work by identifying the individual, social and structural
                determinants of mental health, and then intervening to reduce risks, build resilience and establish
                supportive environments for mental health.</p>
            <p>Reshaping the determinants of mental health often requires action beyond the health sector and so
                promotion and prevention programmes should involve the education, labour, justice, transport,
                environment, housing, and welfare sectors.</p>
            <p>Suicide prevention is a global priority and included in the Sustainable Development Goals.</p>

            <h2>Mental Health Care and Treatment</h2>
            <p>In the context of national efforts to strengthen mental health, it is vital to not only protect and
                promote the mental well-being of all, but also to address the needs of people with mental health
                conditions.</p>
            <p>This should be done through community-based mental health care, which is more accessible and acceptable
                than institutional care, helps prevent human rights violations and delivers better recovery outcomes for
                people with mental health conditions.</p>

            <h2>WHO Response</h2>
            <p>All WHO Member States are committed to implementing the “Comprehensive mental health action plan
                2013–2030", which aims to improve mental health by strengthening effective leadership and governance,
                providing comprehensive, integrated and responsive community-based care, implementing promotion and
                prevention strategies, and strengthening information systems, evidence and research.</p>
            <p>WHO continues to work nationally and internationally to provide governments and partners with the
                strategic leadership, evidence, tools and technical support to strengthen a collective response to
                mental health and enable a transformation towards better mental health for all.</p>
